## GPS Accuracy - TODO

- WSSRC
  - Accurate to within 0.01 knots
  - not necessarily survey equipment but probably RTK, possibly PPP + Doppler (TBC)
- GPSSSWR
  - Accurate to within 0.1 knots
  - COROS not suitable!
- Competition use - e.g. WSW
  - Accurate to within 0.1 knots
  - Motion is perfect
- GPSSS Fun Rankings
  - Accurate to within 0.2 knots
  - Realistically, Locosys or u-box
- Personal use
  - Accurate to within 0.5 knots
  - Many premium smart watches will be ok, except when they are not!



### Frequency vs accuracy

 - more data does not necessarily mean more accurate
 - internal calculation rate often 10 Hz even if logging is 1 Hz - e.g. GT-11
 - Logging at 1 Hz therefore loses data / insight into GPS engine
