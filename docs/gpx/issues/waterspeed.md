## GPS Exchange Format (GPX) - Waterspeed

### Background

Waterspeed currently provides 4 different GPX exports, pertaining to 4 different applications but this really should not be necessary:

![img](img/waterspeed.png)



GPX is a clearly defined standard with a public XSD, specifying how to create GPX files that are compatible with any application.

When the GPX exports from Waterspeed are inspected, it can be seen that none of them are actually GPX-compliant.

Different applications are tolerant of different issues in GPX files, but a single GPX-compliant file would be suitable for any application.



### GPX Validation

There are numerous ways to check compliance and validate a GPX file against the XSD. Several approaches are described at the [GPX home](https://www.topografix.com/gpx_validation.asp), but the simplest approach is to use an online validator such as the one at [freeformatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html).

This example has been fixed by hand to ensure compliance with the GPX 1.1 schema. Simply paste it into the [XML Validator](https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html) and press "Validate XML".

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<gpx version="1.1" creator="Waterspeed"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xmlns="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1"
     xmlns:gpxtpx="http://www.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrackPointExtension/v2"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1 https://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/gpx.xsd
       http://www.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrackPointExtension/v2 https://www8.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrackPointExtensionv2.xsd">

          <gpxtpx:TrackPointExtension>
            <gpxtpx:hr>120</gpxtpx:hr>
            <gpxtpx:speed>0.0028</gpxtpx:speed>
            <gpxtpx:course>248.19</gpxtpx:course>
          </gpxtpx:TrackPointExtension>
        </extensions>
      </trkpt>
    </trkseg>
  </trk>
</gpx>
```



### Changes Required

The above example was based on "GPX - Google Maps, Earth" generated by Waterspeed, but a number of changes were required for GPX compliance.

If these changes are implemented within the Waterspeed application then a single GPX export will be suitable for any application.



#### GPX Schema Location

The URL for the GPX schema at topografix needed to be fixed in `xsi:schemaLocation`:

```xml
<gpx xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1 https://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/gpx.xsd>
```

n.b. This is the https endpoint because freeformatter.com does not support 301 redirects at this time.



#### Garmin Schema Version

TrackpointExtension/v1 does not support course or speed, TrackPointExtension/v2 is required:

```xml
<gpx xmlns:gpxtpx="http://www.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrackPointExtension/v2">
```

n.b. TrackPointExtension/v2 is the only public GPX extension that supports speed and course at this time.



#### Garmin Schema Location

The URL for the Garmin extension needs to be added to `xsi:schemaLocation`:

```xml
<gpx xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1 https://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/gpx.xsd
       http://www.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrackPointExtension/v2 https://www8.garmin.com/xmlschemas/TrackPointExtensionv2.xsd">
```

n.b. The subdomain hosting the Garmin extensions is now https://www8.garmin.com.



#### Timestamps

Timestamps can be formatted in one of two ways in GPX files, generally the "Z" approach is preferred:

```xml
<time>2022-10-29T12:55:24.000Z</time>
<time>2022-10-29T12:55:24.000+00:00</time>
```

The format "+0000" (missing colon) as used in the Google and Strava exports is not valid.



#### Ordering of Elements

The schemas for GPX and the Garmin TrackPointExtension have defined a strict ordering of XML elements.

This example illustrates the correct ordering for elevation, time, heart rate, speed and course:

```xml
<trkpt lat="50.5712706949" lon="-2.4565614465">
  <ele>0</ele>
  <time>2022-10-29T12:55:24.000Z</time>
  <extensions>
    <gpxtpx:TrackPointExtension>
      <gpxtpx:hr>120</gpxtpx:hr>
      <gpxtpx:speed>0.0028</gpxtpx:speed>
      <gpxtpx:course>248.19</gpxtpx:course>
    </gpxtpx:TrackPointExtension>
  </extensions>
</trkpt>
```

Notes:

- `<ele>` and `<time>` are written in the wrong order in the "GPX - Strava, Relive" export
- `<gpxtpx:hr>` should always come before `<gpxtpx:speed>` and `<gpxtpx:course>`.



#### Heart Rate

A heart rate of "0" is invalid according to the XSD of Garmin's TrackPointExtension.

When heart rate is unknown, it should be omitted from the trackpoint.



#### Elevation

An elevation of "0" should not be included in trackpoints, unless the elevation has actually been measured as zero.

When elevation is unknown, it should be omitted from the trackpoint.

Ideally, elevation as calculated by the GPS / GNSS receiver should be recorded.



### Additional Observations

#### GPX Compliance

- Strava export is missing "creator"
  - This is one of the mandatory attributes in the `<gpx>` element
- The GPSAR export uses `<gpxdata:speed>` which is invalid as it has no associated schema
  - The authors of GPSAR and GPSResults has been notified that `<gpxtpx:speed>` is the valid approach
- The Garmin export uses "ns3" instead of "gpxtpx", and does not include course or speed
  - Garmin enforces strict GPX validation within their software, but GPX-compliant files will always be fine
  - Garmin will validate GPX extensions that they recognise, and ignore extensions that they don't recognise
  - There is no reason to omit speed and course from the Garmin export, simply use TrackPointExtension/v2
  - GPX writers are free to choose any namespace prefix (e.g. "ns3" or "gpxtpx"), but "gpxtpx" is pretty universal



#### Data Values

- Timestamps are out by one hour in the GPSAR export, differing from the 3 other GPX exports
  - All times in GPX files should be in UTC and not specific to one application



### Speed

Use of `<gpxdata:speed>` invalidates a GPX files so it should be avoided. In the not too distant future GPSAR, GPSResults, and GPS-Speedsurfing should be expected to support `<gpxtpx:speed>`, now that the topic has been brought to their attention.

There may be a transition period where both `<gpxdata:speed>` and `<gpxtpx:speed>` are included in a single GPX file (e.g. uploads to GPS-Speedsurfing), but this should be regarded as a temporary measure. The inclusion of `<gpxdata:speed>` in GPX exports will definitely be regarded as invalid by Garmin software which requires strict GPX-compliance.

In the future, there will be no requirement for `<gpxdata:speed>`. GPX files including `<gpxtpx:speed>` are fully compliant with the schemas for GPX 1.1 and TrackPointExtension v2.



### Summary

Ensuring that GPX exports from Waterspeed are GPX-compliant will mean that the 4 existing GPX exports can replaced with a single GPX export.

The changes are all relatively straightforward to implement, and validation of GPX files during development is extremely simple using [freeformatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html).

I hope this information is helpful, and I hope the Waterspeed developer(s) can find the time to implement these changes.
