## GPS Exchange Format (GPX) - ESP-GPS

### GPX 1.0

The GPX files created by the ESP-GPS are fine as of firmware 5.63.

They use GPX 1.0 and include the correct header.



### Notes

- GPX 1.0 support was added in firmware 5.62 during Dec 2022
- Indentation was originally lacking but has been submitted as a pull request
