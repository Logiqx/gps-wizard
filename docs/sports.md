### Sky Diving

[Speed skydiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skydiving) is a genuine sport and they have their own approved GPS device:

- [FlySight](https://www.flysight.ca/) by Bionic Avionics Inc
  - Uses the [NEO-6Q](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-6-series) which is an older generation GPS-only product from u-blox. See FlySight [schematics](http://flysight.ca/wiki/index.php/Schematics) page.
  - NED north + east velocity are recorded in the CSV output, taken from UBX-NAV-PVT

A couple of statistics:

- [Speed skydivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skydiving) can reach speeds of up to 500 km/h ≈ 140 m/s, typically jumping from around 4 km.
- [Space divers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_diving) have recorded speeds of 1,357.64 km/h ≈ 377 m/s, jumping from an elevation of 41 km.

The drag racing community feel the Dragy is very close to official laser times on a track, typically 0.01 to 0.02 seconds different.
