## Filtering

### 5Hz and 10Hz - Acceleration

TODO - I am yet to write this topic up!



### Frequency

- Higher frequency units show higher acceleration.
  - 10 Hz Motion > 5 Hz GW-60 > 1 Hz COROS
  - GPS Results 6.173 PC / 5.63 Mac changed maximum acceleration for 10 Hz units to 10m/sÂ².
- Higher frequencies have distances (m) closer to intended - e.g. 500.3m vs 503.8m.

Note that higher frequency logs take significantly longer to process in GPSResults - **TBC 6.185**
