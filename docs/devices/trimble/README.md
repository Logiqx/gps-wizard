   "a. Receiver logging rates shall be set at 10 Hertz, which results in a GPS position every 1/10th of a second."
     "The GPS system shall provide time stamp with each position that are accurate to within .001 second."
   "b. Record claims that include a horizontal position error (hpe) of greater than 0.10 metre (one sigma) during the run shall not be accepted."
   "c. The nominated start and finish points shall be at least 500 metres apart, plus the hpe at the start and the hpe at the finish."
   "d. Distance and time may be interpolated between the two measured positions bracketing the 500 metres (plus 2 hpe used in para b above) finishing point. The results are added to those from starting point to the first measurement point bracketing the finish point. For the calculation of distances, GPS coordinates supplied to the WSSRC shall be in latitude and longitude using the WGS84 datum. The WSSRC will calculate the distance as the length of a geodesy on the WGS84 ellipsoid using the Vincenty method."
   Margin "Where WSSRC approved GPS survey equipment is used, the margin is 1/100th second."
   "i. A qualified surveyor's report that identifies a distance accuracy assessment of each GPS unit shall be provided by the organiser who shall have a qualified surveyor perform such tests using a properly calibrated Theodolite Survey Instrument over a 500 metre distance. The accuracy of each unit must be better than 0.05 metre."
   "ii. A software "authenticity certificate" shall be provided by the organiser. This should identify the Geomatics Office version number, the serial number of the software and the name of the licensed agent who performed the installation."

   "Appendix - The Trimble GPS survey system is WSSRC approved."
   "1. The original *t01 files for the record run from each receiver.These files shall be submitted within one week of the claimed record run."
   "2. The csv files for the record run including continuous data from 5 seconds before the start to 5 seconds after the finish points, including the hpe, GPS time and WGS84 latitude longitude, for each 0.1 second GPS epoch."

 NMEA outputs and presumably Trimble binary as well

 45-46 knot runs so maybe 2008/2009?
 "(interestingly, these numbers varied quite a bit in some instances from those taken off the GT-11 hand held units which are preferred by some other speed sailors with craft too small to carry the TRIMBLE"

 "From trials carried out so far, the biggest inaccuracy was 12 MM!!!"

 "Fresh off the TRIMBLE... 68.01 over 1 second, 65.45 over 500 meters."

 "THIS IS THE LITTLE GPS WHICH WE TAKE ON THE COURSE TO INDICATE WHAT WE JUST DID. THE ACTUAL RECORD DATA IS ON THE BIGGER, MORE ACCURATE TRIMBLE GPS... BUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A DISPLAY. IT INDICATED A LITTLE FASTER THAN THIS AS A PEAK ALTHOUGH THE 500 METER AVERAGES WERE ALMOST IDENTICAL."
