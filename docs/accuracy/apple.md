â€‹	- **Broadcom** [BCM47764KUBG](http://www.szmjd.com/proclass-read-id-1193992.html) GNSS receiver. Possible typo and it is really a BCM47754KUBG?

Series 8 and ultra support Glonass but SE (2nd generation) does not.



### Phones

[Where is a navigation chip in my iPhone?](https://medium.com/@ilyakorogodin/where-is-a-navigation-chip-in-my-iphone-92ab55a61863) by Ilya Korogodin May 2022

- iPhone 3G released Jul 2008 used the [Infineon PMB 2525 Hammer-head II](http://datasheet.elcodis.com/pdf2/118/83/1188394/pmb2525.pdf) and was GPS only
- iPhone 4 (GSM) released Jun 2010 used the **Broadcom BCM4750** and was GPS only
- iPhone 4 (CDMA) released Jun 2010 used the **Qualcomm MDM6600** and was GPS only
- iPhone 4S released in Oct 2011 added support for GLONASS using the **Qualcomm MDM6610**

> As we can see, the fusion of GNSS and telecommunication functions in a single chip became mainstream. Since the iPhone 4 model, we cannot isolate a special GNSS chip: repair it, calculate the cost, calculate power consumption, and so on. The GNSS receiver disappeared as a separated object.

- iPhone 5 released Sep 2012 used the **Qualcomm MDM9615** chip (gpsOneGen 8A)
  - In contrast to MDM6610 it is just a digital baseband processor, analogue processing was taken out to Qualcomm RTR8600.
- iPhone 5S, 5C released Sep 2013 began to support Beidou
  - iPhones 5S and 5C use a **Qualcomm** [WTR1605L](https://investor.qualcomm.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/63/qualcomm-introduces-28nm-mass-market-ltedc-hspa-chipsets) RF transceiver instead of the RTR one
- iPhone 6 released Sep 2014
  - Baseband processor was replaced by **Qualcomm MDM9625M** (IZat gpsOneGen 8B)
  - Assisted GPS and GLONASS - [Apple](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP705?locale=en_GB)
- iPhone 7 release Sep 2016 used an **Intel** PMB9943 (aka Intel XMM7360)
  - Assisted GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and QZSS - [Apple](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP743?locale=en_GB)

- iPhone 8 and X released in Sep / Nov 2017 had **Qualcomm** and **Intel** versions
  - Built-in GPS/GNSS - [Apple](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP767?locale=en_GB)

- iPhone XS and XR released Oct / Nov 2018 replaced Qualcomm completely:
  - **Intel** PMB9955 ([XMM7560](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/mobile-communications/xmm-7560-brief.html)) is used and supports all GNSS systems: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Beidou.
- iPhone 11 released in Sep 2019 has an **Intel** X927YD2Q ([XMM7660](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/mobile-communications/xmm-7660-brief.html))
- iPhone 12 released Oct 2020 used the **Qualcomm** Snapdragon X55M SoC
  - GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and BeiDou - [Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-12/specs/)

- iPhone 13 released Sep 2021 used **Qualcomm** Snapdragon X60M SoC

> So, how does a regular navigation receiver look in 2022? It has dissolved in telecommunication chips. The chips are developed by a few big companies.
