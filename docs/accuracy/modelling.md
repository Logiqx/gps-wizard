- Numerous ways this can be calculated but the most obvious is UERE * DOP, giving 1-sigma.

- [Estimation of the position error in GPS receivers](https://www.foi.se/rest-api/report/FOI-R--3840--SE) (Feb 2014) shows use of [**GST**](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/NMEA.html#_gst_gps_pseudorange_noise_statistics) message on page 16
  - **sqrt(sigmaN^2 + sigmaE^2)**
  - Comes from Kalman filter or LSQ estimator
  - C/N0 also reduces when position fix is degraded
  - Doppler spread deviation seems to increase in a region close to the increased position error. 
  - Pseudo ranges are affected approximately during the time of increased position error.
  - The range residuals are the differences between the measured pseudo ranges and the distances from the satellites to the position solution calculated by the receiver. The deviation from zero increases in the neighborhood of the larger position error. 
  - Figure 13 and 14 are good. Shows actual errors vs predicted errors. Repeated in figure 22.

    - "Bias errors cannot be measured and will typically not be detected in the EPE calculation."

  - [GPS Accuracy Estimate (EPE) What is It ?](https://interpine.nz/gps-accuracy-estimate-epe-what-is-it/)
    - most regard Garmin GPS to use an EPE based of 50% circular error probable (CEP).

    - "EPE uses DOP and other factors to calculate a horizontal position error, in feet or meters."
