- background
  - calculating speeds down a 500 meter / 1852 meter course is a software problem
  - to the best of my knowledge, nobody has documented how perform such calculations
  - the closest is Manfred's paper from 2007 but it does not consider fixed courses
  - implementation is not trivial and will require some careful thought
  - it makes sense to properly investigate the various approaches
  - findings should be documented and made readily available, prior to implementation

- 4 methods for calculating speed over 500 meters are described in Manfred's paper
  - my terminology of PD-speed and DD-speed
  - accumulated PD-speed
  - projected PD-speed
  - accumulated DD-speed
  - projected DD-speed (appendix 1 + 2)

- linear interpolation
  - Useful at 1 Hz due to speeds approximating 20 m/s
  - considers the slowest segment at the start or end of the run

- 500 meter + 1852 meter courses
  - geofencing
  - projected PD-speed, accumulated PD-speed or DD-speed
  - angle of course vs projected speed of run
    - calculation of projected DD-speed can consider the angle of the course
    - calculation of projected PD-speed needs to be rotated
  - linear interpolation for start and end?

- High frequency logging
  - 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz
  - Noise / jitter
  - distance travelled in 200 ms @ 40 kts = 4 meters
  - linear interpolation becomes less useful

- Impact of positional errors
  - Measurement error, maybe 2 to 4 meters
  - Ephemeris changes every 30 mins to 2 hrs
  - Assuming 2 m error in both directions (start and end) that is so 4 m in total
  - 496 / 500 * 40 = 39.68 kts, 504 / 500 * 40 = 40.32 kts, thus +/- 0.32 kts and 0.64 kts possible difference
  - The issue is that the accuracy of the start and end points each have huge significance
  - The safest bet is the DD-speeds because individual errors are diluted and potentially cancel out

- Analysis of 2024 + 2025 POS data
  - calculate projected DD-speed
  - calculate projected PD-speed
  - validate using GPSResults
  - understanding hAcc and sAcc
  - Mortefon example
    - perhaps PD-speed be used as a sanity check the DD-speed?
	- analogy of using Doppler to verify TDCP measurements

- Analysis of WR attempt in June 2025
  - collate video times
  - collate Motion / ESP / LISA logs
  - verify projected DD-speed
  - verify projected PD-speed

- Assessment of available devices
  - accuracy of Motions
  - accuracy of ESP
  - accuracy of LISA

- Development of open source algorithm(s)
  - accumulated DD-speed
  - projected PD-speed
  - accumulated PD-speed (optional)
  - quality filters (e.g. sats, sAcc, hAcc, etc)
  - include test data from POS
  - include unit tests

- GPS enhancements - LISA / ESP / APPro
  - User interface
  - Filters (e.g. sats, sAcc, hAcc, etc)
  - Log file (e.g. all runs)
  - Longer term would be real-time via WiFi
