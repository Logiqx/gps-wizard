## Water Speed Jibes

This is just to capture some thoughts regarding what could be shown in Waterspeed.



### Individual Jibes

Individual jibes currently show the following metrics:

- Average Speed
- Entry Speed
- Exit Speed

Aside from identifying more appropriate start / end points, the following additional metrics would be very useful:

- Min Speed
- Retained Speed (%) = Min Speed / Entry Speed
- Score (integer) = Average Speed * Retained Speed (%) * 10

n.b. Min Speed and Retained Speed are the key jibe metrics reported by [GpsarPro](https://gpsactionreplay.free.fr/) and [GPS Speedreader](https://github.com/prichterich/GPS-Speedreader).



### Session Summary

The session summary currently includes the four metrics highlighted in red.

In addition, it would be beneficial to show the following stats:

- Best Average Speed
- Best Entry Speed
- Best Exit Speed
- Best Min Speed
- Best Retained Speed (%)
- Best Score

The concept of the best 5 gybes is also appealing to people in the Waterspeed group chat.

- 5 x Average Speed
- 5 x Entry Speed
- 5 x Exit Speed
- 5 x Min Speed
- 5 x Retained Speed (%)
- 5 x Score

The average jibe / tack speed for an entire session isn't particularly useful for windsurfing, perhaps not for winging either?

The "best 5" metrics could perhaps supersede "Average Jibe Speed".



### Tacking

Everything discussed above also applies to tacking since all of the metrics are equally useful.
