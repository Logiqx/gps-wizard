## GPS Wizard

This project contains a collection of Python modules that have been created to analyze speedsurfing GPS tracks.

The ultimate goal is to provide a generic data science toolkit to facilitate adhoc analysis of speedsurfing track data.

All of the existing documentation is available on [GitHub pages](https://logiqx.github.io/gps-wizard/).
